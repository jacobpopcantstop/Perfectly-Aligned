# Card Style Guide

## Purpose
This guide defines how to write new prompt cards so they feel consistent with the current Perfectly Aligned deck.

## Card Formula
Use one of these lead-ins:
- `Ways to ...`
- `Types of ...`
- `First things to ...`
- `Reasons to ...`
- `Excuses for ...`
- `Responses to ...`
- `Things ...`

Keep each card as a short prompt fragment, not a full sentence.

## Voice and Tone
- Conversational and playful.
- Broad enough to allow creative interpretations.
- Slightly edgy is okay when the deck calls for it, but avoid confusing wording.

## Clarity Rules
- Prefer plain language over niche jargon.
- Keep to one clear idea per card.
- Use consistent sentence case (lowercase generic nouns).
- Preserve proper nouns/cultural references (`C-Span`, `Y2K`, `Met Gala`, `Area 51`).
- Use parallel phrasing for similar cards (e.g., "Ways to..." list items should read similarly).

## Length Targets
- Ideal: 4-10 words after the lead-in.
- Hard max: ~14 words unless a quote/setup requires more.

## Content Boundaries
- Should be drawable in a timed party game.
- Should be interpretable through alignment lenses.
- Avoid prompts that require specialist knowledge to be playable.

## Quality Checklist
A good card should be:
- `Clear`: Players understand it in one read.
- `Open-ended`: Multiple valid drawing interpretations.
- `Distinct`: Not a near-duplicate of existing cards.
- `Drawable`: Reasonably sketchable in under two minutes.
- `Aligned`: Works across lawful/neutral/chaotic and good/evil lenses.

## Do / Don't
Do:
- `Ways to react to your pet talking`
- `Types of world records to break`
- `Excuses for where you were last night`

Don't:
- Over-specific instructions with multiple constraints.
- Ambiguous grammar that changes meaning.
- Inconsistent capitalization like `Types of Hot Drinks`.

## Deck Fit Guidance
- `core_white`: Everyday situations, social dilemmas, broad accessibility.
- `creative_cyan`: Lists, pop culture, imaginative categories.
- `hypothetical_magenta`: Wild hypotheticals, higher-chaos adult-leaning prompts.

## New Card Templates
- `Ways to react to ___`
- `Ways to handle ___`
- `Types of ___`
- `Reasons to ___`
- `First things to ___`
